You have 30 seconds to type as much as you can.

Real-time Typing Metrics: WPM, CPM, and mistakes are updated in real-time as you type.
Timer: A countdown timer of 30 seconds is displayed and managed.
Responsive Design: The application is styled to be user-friendly and accessible across different devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout of the application.
